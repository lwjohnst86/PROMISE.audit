Package: PROMISE.audit
Title: Identifies Unexpected Values in the PROMISE Datasets
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person("Luke", "Johnston", email = "lwjohnst@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Checks given values of a dataset for "wrong" values (e.g. a DaysPerWeek 
    column should only contain integers 1 to 7 since there are 7 days in a week). 
    Adds these 'flaws' to the data so that a 'flaw' report can be created to look
    into the violations in the raw data source.
